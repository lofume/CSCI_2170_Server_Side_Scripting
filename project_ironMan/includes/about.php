    <h1> About Us </h1>
    <p> The website is meant to allow a user to communicate with a chat bot. The user will ask questions regarding PHP-related topics and receive guidance on what certain PHP commands mean and similar concepts. The website will have a minimalistic design with a search bar in the center. The intention of this is to make sure that the user does not feel overwhelmed by clutter on the website since attention will only be drawn to the search bar. The website will appear very straightforward and user-friendly and allow a user to save transcripts of recent chat conversations with the chat bot. </p>
    <p> The benefit of this Chatbot is to create an educational resource for students in CSCI 2170. The student/user will be able to use Chatbot to find resources and information regarding PHP.  Using Chatbot the user can ask questions into the query and gain a response based on curated questions and pre-determined answers.  The user will also have access to the PHP resource page if an answer is unable on our server. The student will also have access to their most frequently searched questions to refer to and be able to keep the log on their profile page. </p>
